                  <p class="word-spacing">One of the most favorite places in my hometown of Minsk is the city library. One of the main attractions for tourists and a cozy place for locals. The library windows offer a stunning view of the city. The views become especially beautiful in the evening when thousands of lights light up all over the city. The library is not only a reading room, but it is also a recreation area and cafe. My friends and I often came there to chat over a cup of coffee and enjoy the wonderful view of the most beautiful city.</p>

                    <p class="word-spacing">One of the most favorite places in Minsk is Chelyuskintsev Park. The park is located in the city center and will appeal to both children and adults. Chelyuskintsev Park is an amusement park, an ordinary park, a food court, and a concert venue. My favorite attraction is the Ferris wheel. I always have children's sincere emotions of admiration when visiting this attraction. You can watch the whole city from a bird's-eye view. After the rides, I like to walk around the beautiful park and just enjoy the pastime.</p>
